      "en": "I offer praṇāma to śrī guru, by whose abundant mercy I have obtained the topmost name of Śrī Hari, the dīkṣā-mantras, [the service of] Śrī Śacīnandana Gaurahari, Śrī Svarūpa Dāmodara, Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī, his older brother, Śrī Sanātana Gosvāmī, the vast abode of Śrī Mathurā, Vraja, Rādhā-kuṇḍa, and Govardhana, as well as a desire for [the loving service of] Śrī Śrī Rādhā Mādhava. \n\nI offer praṇāma unto Śrīla Gurudeva, who awards all spiritual perfection, who is the embodiment of all auspiciousness, and who bestows all happiness.\n\nO Gurudeva, you bestow transcendental knowledge and you are the friend of the fallen. You bestow the spiritual bliss that exists within your own heart and you are an ocean of mercy. You are a resident of Vṛndāvana and the incarnation of auspiciousness. You preach about Śrī Rādhā’s love for Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Please be merciful to me.\n\nPlease deliver me, O most worshipful śrī guru. You are the shelter of the living beings of this world. I am burned by the fire of material existence and devoured by time; thus I have come to take shelter of you.\n\nI forever worship śrī guru in his form as an exalted sakhī in the company of Śrī Rādhā and the other sakhīs.\n\nWhen will Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī, who established within this world the mission to fulfill the dearmost desires of the heart of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, personally give me the shelter of his feet?\n\nClasping a straw between my teeth, I repeatedly beg to attain the dust of the lotus feet of Śrīmad Rūpa Gosvāmī birth after birth.\n\nI was unwilling to drink the nectar of bhakti-rasa, laced with renunciation, but Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī, being an ocean of mercy who cannot tolerate the suffering of others, induced me to drink it. Therefore, I take shelter of Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī.\n\nMay Śrī Śacīnandana Gaurahari, resplendent with the radiance of molten gold, be forever manifest within the innermost core of your heart. He has descended in the age of Kali, out of causeless mercy, to bestow that which had not been revealed for millions of eons—unnatojjvala-rasa, the most elevated, brilliant devotional service in paramour love. \n\nI have fallen into the ocean of birth and death, which is full of misery, and I am being devoured by the crocodiles and sharks of lust, anger, greed, and so forth. Furthermore, I am chained by wicked desires. O Caitanya-candra, please give me, who is bereft of shelter, sanctuary at Your feet.\n\nO Caitanya-candra, please make the lotus flower of my heart bloom so that it will attract the bumblebee of remembrance of You. O merciful Lord, [my other request is that,] after destroying the dense darkness of my offenses, You make this miserable person drink the nectar of Your feet.\n\nSaṅkarṣaṇa, Śeṣa Nāga, and the Viṣṇus who lie on the Kāraṇa, Garbha, and Kṣīra Oceans are the plenary portions and portions of the plenary portions of Śrī Nityānanda Rāma. May He give me shelter.\n\nI offer praṇāma unto Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, who bestows the bliss of divine love, who eliminates the filth of the age of Kali, and who is the master of Jāhnavā-devī.\n\nI worship the incarnations of mercy, Śrī Gaura-Nityānanda, whose arms extend to Their knees, whose complexions are dazzling, who inaugurated the saṅkīrtana movement, whose eyes are large like lotus petals, who nourish the entire universe, who are the best of brāhmaṇas, who protect the yuga-dharma, and who are engaged in performing pleasing activities for the welfare of the world.\n\nHis crown is decorated with a peacock feather, and His forehead is marked with tilaka of musk. [Makara-shaped] earrings swing upon His cheeks, His eyes resemble a lotus, His neck resembles a conch, and His face is graced with a gentle smile. A veṇu flute rests upon His lips, His complexion is darkish, He is supremely peaceful, and He stands in a threefold bending posture. His cloth resembles the rays of the sun, and He is adorned with a vaijayantī garland. I worship that Parabrahma, who is always situated in Śrī Vṛndāvana, surrounded by hundreds of young maidens and dressed in the attire of a cowherd boy.\n\nHis forehead is decorated with musk tilaka, the Kaustubha jewel rests upon His broad chest, and an exquisite pearl hangs from the tip of His nose. The flute gracefully rests in His lotus hands, and bracelets adorn His wrists. His entire form is anointed with candana, and a necklace of pearls graces His attractive neck. All glories to the crest-jewel of the gopas, who is surrounded by all the young vraja-gopīs.\n\nUpon His shining moon-like face rests a vaṁśī flute, His gentle smile exudes an incomparable brilliance, and He is attired in excellent yellow cloth. His eyes are like lotuses, He is expert in all arts, and His bodily complexion is like that of a fresh monsoon cloud. His head is adorned with a peacock feather, He is the shelter for those surrendered to Him, and He stands in a delightful threefold bending posture. He is surrounded by the youthful maidens of Vraja, and He subdues Keśī and other demons. I offer prayers to that Śrī Nanda-nandana, the crest-jewel of infinite sweetness and the very embodiment of mādhurya-rasa. \n\nI worship Govinda, whose complexion is the color of a blossoming blue lotus. His face is like the moon, and He is fond of wearing a peacock feather in His crown. His chest bears the mark of Śrīvatsa and is adorned with the Kaustubha gem. He wears beautiful yellow garments, and His handsome form is worshiped by the gopīs’ sidelong glances. His companions are multitudes of cows and cowherd boys. He plays sweet melodies on the flute, and His body is decorated with glittering ornaments.\n\nI offer praṇāma unto He whose eyes are like lotus flowers, who merrily plays the flute, who is expert in drinking the nectar of Śrī Rādhā’s lips, and who is adorned with a garland of forest flowers.\n\n[Upon Śrī Kṛṣṇa releasing them from the captivity of Jarāsandha, the 20,800 kings prayed as follows:] Time and again we offer praṇāma to Śrī Kṛṣṇa. He is the son of Vasudeva, He is Śrī Hari, He is the Supreme Soul, He is Govinda, and He vanquishes the distress of all who surrender unto Him.\n\nHer complexion is like that of a spotless lotus flower, She is attired in blue cloth, and Her hair is very beautiful. Her face is like the full moon, Her eyes—like those of a wagtail—are very charming, and upon Her breasts rests a radiant pearl necklace. She is eternally youthful, and She is the dearmost lover of the son of the king of Vraja. I take shelter of that Śrīmatī Rādhikā\n\nO Devī Gāndharvikā, in utter distress, falling to the ground like a rod, I implore You in a choked voice full of despair, praying at Your lotus feet: please be merciful to this fool and count me as one of Your own.\n\nRādhe, Queen of Vṛndāvana, You are a river of nectarean mercy. Please mercifully bless me with the service of Your lotus feet.\n\nHer bodily complexion is like gold and His is like a fresh monsoon cloud, Her eyes are like blue lotus flowers and His like red lotuses, and Their foreheads are decorated with musk tilaka. She wears a garland of mālatī flowers around Her neck and He of kunda flowers, and They are dressed in a charming, youthful fashion, She is wearing a blue dress and He a yellow garment. O mind, just meditate on Śrīmatī Rādhikā and Śrī Kṛṣṇacandra within the solitary nikuñjas [of Vraja]. \n\nHis dark bodily luster eclipses a blue lotus, His brilliant yellow garments rebuke the radiance of golden kuṅkuma, He revels in pastimes within Śrī Vṛndāvana, His chest is beautified by a splendid vaijayantī garland, and His splendorous left hand rests upon the shoulder of Śrī Rādhā. I meditate upon that Śrī Dāmodara.\n\nI worship Śrī Navadvīpa-dhāma, where Kṛṣṇa appeared in a golden form to bestow that bhakti which had never been given before; where the newly arisen forest is made more beautiful by the flowing Gaṅgā with her gentle, cool breezes; where Śrīmatī Rādhikā and Śrī Hari appeared in a new, combined form to give that kīrtana which is saturated with rasa; and where an ever-fresh, new taste [of the original devotional mellow, śṛṅgāra-rasa]is mercifully bestowed.\n\nAll glories, all glories to Śrī Vṛndāvana, which is gloriously exalted as the dearmost residence of Śrī Murāri, who loves to live here even more than in the lotus hearts of the saints or in Śrī Vaikuṇṭha-dhāma. Here in His eternal pastimes, He personally tends all the cows and, playing the sweetest melodies on His flute, gives pleasure to the gopīs by increasing their love for pastimes of rāsa. \n\nŚrī Paurṇamāsī is completely adept at arranging the most elevated varieties of enjoyment for the master of Śrī Rādhā. Her lotus feet are worshiped by the Vrajavāsīs. Due to possessing all good qualities, beginning with kindness, she is worshipful for the entire universe. I bow my head and offer praṇāma unto that Śrī Paurṇamāsī-devī.\n\nAll glories to the emperor of all the principal mountains, Śrī Girirāja-Govardhana, who is exalted in all splendor; who the gopīs proclaim to be haridāsa-varya, the best servant of Śrī Hari; whose worship was introduced by Śrī Kṛṣṇa when the Lord stopped the sacrifice for worshiping Indra, and who then received the good fortune of resting continuously on Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s lotus hand for one whole week.\n\nGirirāja Govardhana rested like a bee upon the lotus hand of Acyuta for seven days. He expertly serves Śrī Hari and Śrī Hari’s dear associates by providing them with fruits, roots, and caves. I bow my head and offer praṇāma unto that Govardhana Hill.\n\nO protector of the land of Vṛndāvana, O husband of Umā, O Somamauli, you who carry the moon on your head! O you who are worshiped by Sanandana, Sanātana, and Nārada! O Gopeśvara, please bestow upon me unconditional prema for the lotus feet of Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, who perform loving pastimes in Vraja. \n\nYamunā-devī is a reservoir of prema for Śrī Nanda-nandana, and the sun of spiritual bliss. Her body is made of liquid transcendence, she destroys all sins, and brings auspiciousness to the world. May that Yamunā-devī, daughter of the Sun-god, purify our bodies.\n\nHer lotus feet are always served by Gaṅgā and all other holy tīrthas. She is glorious, due to bestowing service saturated with rasa to Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa Yugala in Goloka-Vṛndāvana. In her nectar-filled waters, Śrī Rādhā-Mukunda remain immersed in an ocean of happiness. I offer praṇāma to that Yamunā.\n\nAlthough Brahmā is always busy carrying out his many weighty duties, including creating the material universe, still, he longs to take birth in Vṛndāvana as a blade of grass, a shrub, or in any other species. With the utmost humility I worship each of the dear devotees who reside in that Vṛndāvana. They are all supremely worshipful and highly pious."

      "en": "In the beginning of creation Śrī Kṛṣṇa spoke the science of devotional service to Lord Brahmā. He in turn passed these teachings on to Śrī Nārada Muni, who accepted Śrī Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana Vyāsadeva as his disciple. Śrī Vyāsa transmitted this knowledge to Śrī Madhvācārya, who is also known as Pūrṇaprajña Tīrtha and who is the sole refuge for his disciple Śrī Padmanābha Tīrtha.\n\nFollowing forth from Śrī Madhvācārya were Nṛhari Tīrtha, Śrī Mādhava Tīrtha, and then the swan-like Śrī Akṣobhya Tīrtha. The principal disciple of Śrī Akṣobhyatīrtha was known as Śrī Jayatīrtha, and Śrī Jñānasindhu was his servant.\n\nThe paramparā continued with Śrī Dayānidhi, then his disciple Śrī Vidyānidhi, and next with Śrī Rājendra Tīrtha, whose servant was Śrī Jayadharma, also known as Śrī Vijayadhvaja Tīrtha. Know well that this is the guru-paramparā.\n\nThe sannyāsī Śrī Puruṣottama Tīrtha, a renowned disciple in the service of Śrī Jayadharma, was succeeded by the erudite Śrī Brahmaṇya Tīrtha. Next in succession was Śrī Vyāsa Tīrtha, who was succeeded by Śrī Lakṣmīpati, who in turn was succeeded by Śrī Mādhavendra Purī.\n\nThe most prominent disciples of the great Śrī Mādhavendra Purī were Śrī Īśvara Purī and the avatāras Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu and Śrī Advaita Ācārya. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the Golden Lord and spiritual preceptor of all the worlds, made Īśvara Purī greatly fortunate by accepting him as His dīkṣā-guru.\n\nŚrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who is Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa combined, is the very life of the rūpānuga Vaiṣṇavas (those who follow Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī). Śrī Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī, Śrī Rūpa, and Śrī Sanātana Gosvāmīs were the dearmost servants of Lord Viśvambhara (Śrī Caitanya).\n\nDear to Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī were the great saintly personalities Śrī Jīva Gosvāmī and Śrī Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī, whose intimate disciple was the great poet Śrī Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja. The dearmost of Kṛṣṇadāsa was Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura, who was always engaged in guru-sevā. His lotus feet were the only hope and aspiration of Śrī Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura.\n\nProminent among the associates of Śrī Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura was Śrī Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa. After him, the line descended to Śrīla Jagannātha dāsa Bābājī Mahārāja, who was the beloved śikṣā-guru of Śrī Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura. Bhaktivinoda was the intimate friend of the great mahā-bhāgavata Śrīla Gaura-kiśora dāsa Bābājī Mahārāja, whose sole delight was hari-bhajana.\n\nŚrī Vārṣabhānavī, the daughter of Śrī Vṛṣabhānu Mahārāja, is the best of Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s beloveds, as She is forever engaged in loving service to Her worshipful Lord. Śrī Vārṣabhānavī-dayita dāsa, the servant (dāsa) of  Her beloved (dayita) is the name of Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura Prabhupāda.\n\nA confidential disciple of Śrīla Prabhupāda, Śrīla Bhakti Prajñāna Keśava Gosvāmī Mahārāja, was a faithful follower of Śrī Svarūpa Dāmodara and Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī. Through his knowledge of Gauḓīya Vedānta, he annihilated the darkness of ignorance spread by māyāvāda. He was the abode of preaching and practicing Śrī Gaurāṅga’s teachings (gauravāṇī) in his own life.\n\nŚrīla Bhaktivedānta Svāmī Mahārāja extensively preached this gauravāṇī and thus completely fulfilled the inner-heart’s desire of Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Prabhupāda.\n\n③ keśav—Śrīla Bhakti Prajñāna Keśava Gosvāmī Mahārāja; priya—dear; mahājan—exalted saints; vāman—Śrī Bhaktivedānta Vāmana Gosvāmī Mahārāja; nārāyaṇ—Śrī Bhaktivedānta Nārāyaṇa Gosvāmī Mahārāja; han—are; ④ gaurabāṇī—the teachings of Gaurāṅga; tā̃’der—their; prāṇ—life; dhan—treasure.\n\nAll of these devotees are the personal associates of Śrī Gaurāṅga. I desire to honor their ucchiṣṭa [the remnants of their lips, namely their mahā-prasāda as well as their instructions]."

Becoming intoxicated by love, his hair stands on end, he shivers, and sheds torrents of tears.

He also engages the devotees (under his guidance) in these services. I adore the lotus feet of that śrī gurudeva.\n\nŚrī guru feels much contentment in satisfying Śrī Hari’s devotees with the four kinds of bhagavat-prasāda—that which is chewed, sucked, licked, and drunk. (By honoring such prasāda, material life is destroyed and true satisfaction, or the bliss of prema, is attained.) I adore the lotus feet of that śrī gurudeva.\n\nAt every moment, śrī gurudeva is experiencing intense greed in his heart to relish the unlimited sweetness of the holy names, forms, qualities, and pastimes of Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Mādhava. I adore the lotus feet of that śrī gurudeva.\n\nIn carrying out the sakhīs’ arrangements for the perfection of Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa’s amorous pastimes within the groves of Vṛndāvana, śrī guru is masterfully adept and thus especially dear to Them. I adore the lotus feet of that śrī gurudeva.\n\nScriptures unanimously proclaim śrī guru to be sākṣāt-hari, directlly Śrī Hari. This is a fact jointly corroborated by all saintly persons. Yet at the same time, śrī guru is very dear to Bhagavān. I adore the lotus feet of that śrī gurudeva (who is inconceivably one with and different from Bhagavān).\n\nĵā̃hāra prasāde kṛṣṇa-kṛpā pāi,\n\nSolely by the mercy of śrī guru one can receive the mercy of Bhagavān; without it, one cannot make any advancement. Meditate on and sing śrī guru’s glories at the three sacred junctions of the day. I adore the lotus feet of that śrī gurudeva.\n\nThat person who, during brāhma-muhūrta, loudly and attentively recites this Guruvāṣṭakam is sure to achieve direct service to the lotus feet of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the life and soul of Vṛndāvana, at the end of his current life (upon attaining vastu-siddhi, his eternal spiritual form)."

      "en": "O wicked mind! What kind of Vaisnava are you? Your chanting, [which you perform] in a solitary place for the sake of prestige, is solely pretense.\n\nWorldly fame is the excrement of hogs. Do you not know that it is the wealth of māyā? What is the use of fixating day and night on wealth and women, when all these are temporary?\n\nYour wealth is a source of sense enjoyment; use it to serve Mādhava, the husband of Lakṣmī-devī. Fulfilling the desires of women is not your domain, for their sole master is Śrī Yādava. [He alone can fully satisfy their desires.] The tree of the desire for prestige is like the mirage in the desert that Rāvaṇa was unable to attain by fighting Śrī Rāghava (Rāmācandra).\n\nBe steadfast in [your acceptance of] the prestige that comes from being a Vaiṣṇava. If you do not observe this, then you will go to [the hellish planet known as] Raurava. Envying the devotees of Śrī Hari is an affliction arising from your desire for prestige, so why do you see so much glory in that prestige?\n\nThe spiritual fame that follows the Vaiṣṇavas is never to be considered a temporary material glory, for it occurs in relation­ship to Śrī Hari and is devoid of the stench of māyā. In it, there is never any mundane duplicity.\n\nKnow that the dog-eating outcaste woman of worldly prestige and the snare of solitude [that is, solitary bhajana] are both illusory hells. “I shall give up kīrtana and smear myself with worldly honor [by performing solitary bhajana]”—what is the use of seeking such “glory”?\n\nAlways know that Mādhavendra Purī never stole [that is, he never falsely displayed] the symptoms of bhāva. Your fame is the excrement of hogs; never consider it to be equivalent to his.\n\nUnder the control of envy, you have drowned yourself in mundane rasa by renouncing the sublime beauty of kīrtana. There­fore, O wicked mind, you fraudulently propagate solitary bhajana, which is the [useless] wealth of a false renunciate.\n\nYou should meditate upon all that Śrīman Mahaprabhu taught with great care to Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī. Never forget the following two instructions: (1) chant the holy names of Śrī Hari in a loud voice and (2) never consider phalgu- and yukta-vairagya (false and appropriate renunciation) to be the same, and never consider baddha- and mukta-jīvas (bound and liberated souls) to be the same.\n\nThat person whom wealth, women, and the tigress of prestige have given up is indeed a Vaiṣṇava.  Such a person is a detached, pure devotee before whom material existence accepts defeat.\n\nWhere only those sense objects necessary to maintain the body are accepted, there is no disease [or pitfall]. What else can be said about such detachment? When free from attachment, one sees all objects of enjoyment in connection with Mādhava.\n\nThis is appropriate renunciation, and great fortune is found there. Indeed, in the material realm, the wealth of Śrī Hari is found therein. However, the glory of one who performs kīrtana to enhance his reputation is merely fraudulent.\n\nGive up both the desire of renouncing worldly objects and craving for mundane pleasure, O mind, for both are unbefitting a Vaiṣṇava. Connection [of these two propensities] with Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the source of transcendence. That [connection] is never possible for materialists.\n\nThe hearts of those who accept the philosophy of impersonalism are directed away from Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Arrogant about their liberation, they blaspheme the Vaiṣṇavas. Your aspiration for bhakti depends on service to the Vaiṣṇavas, so why have you invited this struggle with solitude?\n\nA false renunciate who calls himself an ascetic can never become a Vaiṣṇava. By giving up the lotus feet of Śrī Hari and increasing his solitude, the glory of whatever result he obtains is simply a sham.\n\nBecoming situated in rādhā-dāsya (the service of Śrī Rādhā), release yourself from the serpent of material enjoyment. Know that the desire for respect and adoration is not the glory of kīrtana. O mind, having given up the association of Śrī Rādhā’s eternal servants, why have you adopted the fraudulent practice of solitary bhajana?\n\nThe residents of Vraja are the true preachers and wealth [of the Lord]. They are not beggars of worldly fame, who are like corpses. Indeed, because they are infused with life, they propagate the narrations of Śrī Kṛṣṇa everywhere, devoid of any desire for prestige.\n\nŚrī Dayita dāsa places all his hopes in kīrtana. [O mind,] chant the names of Śrī Hari in a loud voice, because through the potency of kīrtana, remembrance of the Lord will arise.  Only at that time will solitary bhajana be possible."

Govinda!—reverberates loudly.\n\nThe sounds of the mṛdaṅga, mandirā (small, cup-shaped cymbals), conch, and karatāla all blend nicely with the saṅkīrtana.\n\nThe thunderous sound penetrates the universe, filling the whole sky. Everything inauspicious in all four directions is annihilated.\n\nAt dawn, Viśvambhara dances while the [kīrtana] groups formed sing charmingly.\n\nOne group is with Śrīvāsa Paṇḍita, and many others sing with Mukunda Datta.\n\nThere are many more with Govinda Ghoṣa. As Gaura-candra dances, everyone performs kīrtana.\n\nThe mighty Nityānanda Prabhu holds onto Mahāprabhu and gently strokes Him, while Advaita Ācārya secretly takes His foot dust.\n\nTheir eyes brimming with tears, Gadādhara and others become over­whelmed in transcendental happiness, due to Mahāprabhu’s kīrtana.\n\nWhen Viśvambhara dances with great force, the Earth trembles and everyone becomes afraid.\n\nSometimes Viśvambhara dances so sweetly that He appears to be the son of Nanda, the best of dancers.\n\nTheir eyes filled with joy, Mahāprabhu’s servants observe His unprecedented love for Śrī Kṛṣṇa and His incomparably beautiful dancing.\n\nMahāprabhu Viśvambhara dances, rejoicing in His own trans­cendental happiness. The rhythmic sound of His lotus feet is extremely captivating.\n\nUnder the weight of His ecstatic emotions, His garland is unable to remain around His neck. Breaking apart, it falls at the feet of the devotees.\n\nThe auspiciousness of śrī harināma saṅkīrtana spreads in all four directions as the son of Jagannātha Miśra dances in the midst [of the devotees].\n\nAbsorbed in the bliss of Śrī Hari’s name, Śiva becomes oblivious to his own clothing. He whose glories impel Śiva to dance in ecstasy also dances Himself.\n\nBy His name, Vālmīki achieved the wealth of austerity, and by His name, Ajāmila received deliverance.\n\nBy hearing His name, the bindings of the material world are destroyed. That Lord, having descended, dances in the age of Kali.\n\nHis name is chanted by Śukadeva and Nārada as they wander about. His glories are sung by the Lord of innumerable mouths [Śrī Anantadeva].\n\nHis name constitutes the highest form of atonement. That Lord dances while those who are supremely fortunate look on.\n\nSeeing Mahāprabhu’s transcendental bliss, the associates of the Lord embrace each other and weep.\n\nSandal paste and garlands grace everyone’s bodies. They sing in great bliss, forgetting their own selves, due to immersion in kṛṣṇa-rasa.\n\nEntranced in kīrtana, all the Vaiṣṇavas lose complete sense of their own bodies and of everyone around them.\n\nDelighted, everyone sings day and night, “Jaya Kṛṣṇa, Murāri, Mukunda, Vanamālī!”\n\nDay and night, Viśvambhara dances with the devotees, but they never become fatigued, because their bodies are fully transcendental.\n\nIn such a manner, Mahāprabhu Viśvambhara dances the entire night, except for one prahara [during which He sleeps].\n\nIn this way, transcendental happiness arises in the land of Navadvīpa as the hero of Vaikuṇṭha sports in prema-rasa.\n\nGaura-candra and His associates remain in the hearts of those who hear this entire auspicious description.\n\nVṛndāvana dāsa offers this song at the lotus feet of Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya and the moon-like Nityānanda Prabhu."

Yet at the same time, śrī guru is very dear to Bhagavān. I adore the lotus feet of that śrī gurudeva (who is inconceivably one with and different from Bhagavān).\n\nSolely by the mercy of śrī guru one can receive the mercy of Bhagavān; without it, one cannot make any advancement. Meditate on and sing śrī guru’s glories at the three sacred junctions of the day. I adore the lotus feet of that śrī gurudeva.\n\nThat person who, during brāhma-muhūrta, loudly and attentively recites this Guruvāṣṭakam is sure to achieve direct service to the lotus feet of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the life and soul of Vṛndāvana, at the end of his current life (upon attaining vastu-siddhi, his eternal spiritual form)."

Dear to both gentlemen and ruffians, always engaged in pleasing activities, and completely free from envy, they are adored by all. They are the recipients of Śrī Caitanya’s immense mercy, and they therefore remove the burden of the earth (through the distribution of bhakti-rasa). I worship [the six Gosvāmīs:] Śrī Rūpa, Śrī Sanātana, Śrī Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa, Śrī Raghunātha dāsa, Śrī Jīva, and Śrī Gopāla Bhaṭṭa.\n\nThey are uniquely expert in ascertaining the essence of all revealed scriptures, and they establish the supreme occupation of the soul (bhagavad-bhakti). They are the true benefactors of the people, worshipful for the three worlds, and affectionate to those who have taken shelter of them. Due to the bliss of bhajana of the lotus feet of Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, they have become like intoxicated honeybees. I worship Śrī Rūpa, Sanātana, Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa, Raghunātha dāsa, Jīva, and Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmīs.\n\nThey are enriched with deep faith in the process of describing the various qualities of Śrī Gaurāṅga. They nullify the great distress generated from the sinful activities of embodied beings by showering on them nectarean songs about Govinda. They are especially expert in expanding the ocean of bliss, and they rescue all from impersonalism (by imparting the secrets of bhakti). I worship Śrī Rūpa, Sanātana, Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa, Raghunātha dāsa, Jīva, and Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmīs.\n\nThey fully abandoned at once the association of kingly aristocracy, deeming it insignificant, and out of compassion they humbly wore only loincloths and ragged quilts. Thereafter, they repeatedly immersed themselves in the delightful, billowing waves in the nectarean ocean of rasa—the bhāvas felt by the gopīs. I worship Śrī Rūpa, Sanātana, Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa, Raghunātha dāsa, Jīva, and Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmīs.\n\nCrowded with sweetly cooing cuckoos, swans, and cranes, as well as groups of peacocks, Vṛndāvana is shining beautifully with trees that have many varieties of gems inlaid beneath their roots. There, day and night, the Gosvāmīs intensely worship Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, thus endowing all jīvas with the ultimate benefit of life. I worship Śrī Rūpa, Sanātana, Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa, Raghunātha dāsa, Jīva, and Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmīs.\n\nThey would pass their time by daily chanting a fixed number of holy names, singing particular songs, and offering regulated obeisances [to saints, deities, and the Lord’s pastime places]. Thus they fully conquered the urges of eating, sleeping, recreation, and so forth. Always considering themselves to be unlimitedly lowly and insignificant, they became enchanted in sweet rapture by remembering Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa’s qualities. I worship Śrī Rūpa, Sanātana, Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa, Raghunātha dāsa, Jīva, and Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmīs.\n\nWandering along the banks of Rādhā-kuṇḍa or the Yamunā, and sometimes at Vaṁśīvaṭa, they would be forever seized by limitless transcendental states, intoxicated by the utter madness of prema. Overwhelmed with bhāva, they would jubilantly sing about the exalted qualities of Śrī Hari. I worship Śrī Rūpa, Sanātana, Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa, Raghunātha dāsa, Jīva, and Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmīs.\n\n“O Rādha, Queen of Vṛndāvana! O Lalitā! O son of Nanda Mahārāja! Where are You? Are You beneath the kalpa-vṛkṣa trees of Śrī Govardhana Hill? Or are you in the forests on the banks of the Kālindī?” Thus calling out, greatly overwhelmed in separation, they would wander throughout the length and breadth of Vraja-maṇḍala. I worship Śrī Rūpa, Sanātana, Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa, Raghunātha dāsa, Jīva, and Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmīs."

He casts upon the saintly a glance from the corners of His merciful eyes. I perpetually worship Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, the root of the kṛṣṇa-bhakti tree.\n\nHe gently held the supremely soft lotus hand of His brother, Their hearts soaring upward in the highest bliss as They gazed at each others’ faces. As He wandered here and there, He delighted the townspeople with His sweetness. I perpetually worship Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, the root of the kṛṣṇa-bhakti tree.\n\nMay Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu’s two lotus feet brilliantly manifest in the hearts of those who recite this unprecedented and supremely potent Nityānandāṣṭakam, which is the reservoir of rasa, the treasure of exalted rasika Vaiṣṇavas, and the abode of the essence of bhakti-rasa.

Alternately, rādhāliṅgita means He finally embraces Śrīmatī Rādhikā after Her māna is broken.]</small>\n\nWhen the supreme object of loving service and the supreme loving servant merge in absolute love, how can any distinction be made between Them? But when They are separated, all of Their distinctions are continuously amplified. <br><br><small>[Śrī Kṛṣṇa is sevyā, the supreme object of service, and bhoktā, the supreme transcendental enjoyer; and Śrīmatī Rādhikā is sevaka, the supreme servant, and bhogya, the supreme transcendental object of His enjoyment. In sambhoga, transcendental union, They are abheda, non-different. However, in vipralambha, transcendental separation, Their bheda, or duality, in the form of unique qualities, is amplified more and more.]</small>\n\nThe Divine Couple, who eternally engage in transcendental pastimes, comprise an existential reality that is inconceivably differentiated and non-differentiated, for the supreme potency and the supreme possessor of potency are always one with each other. <br><br><small>[Para-tattva, the supreme existential reality, is never without His energy, śakti. When śakti (potency) and śaktimān (the supreme source of all potency) have a single form, then gaura-tattva, the reality of Śrī Gaura-candra, is manifest. And when They are in two separate bodies, līlā-puruṣottama Śrī Kṛṣṇa enjoys unlimited transcendental pastimes with Śrīmatī Rādhikā.]</small>\n\nOne should know that the Absolute Truth, which is one without a second, has divided His pastimes into two parts. Gaura is Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa is Gaura; hence both of Them are factually the original form of Godhead.<br><br><small>[Although the Supreme Absolute Truth is one, He has two sets of pastimes. In one, He is Śyāmasundara Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and in the other He is Śrī Gaurasundara. Śyāmasundara is Gaurasundara, and Gaurasundara is Śyāmasundara. Thus both of them are in fact Svayam Bhagavān, the Original Supreme Personality of Godhead from whom all other forms of God are manifest.]</small>\n\nWherever all colors exist simultaneously, a golden hue is manifest. However, in the absence of all color, a black hue is manifest.<br><br><small>[According to natural science, when the entire visible light spectrum is present in naturally occurring proportions, as in the sun, a golden hue is manifest. In Sanskrit, this is called gaura-kānti. On the other hand, when all visible light is absent, a black hue is manifest. This is called śyāma-kānti.]</small>\n\nThe Supreme Absolute Truth, which is one without a second, is both replete with qualities and devoid of qualities. All transcendental qualities are eternally manifest in Śrī Gaura. And the totality of transcendental humors, completely devoid of any mundane qualities, is manifest in Śrī Kṛṣṇa.<br><br><small>[The word varṇa (complexion) in the previous verse and the word guṇa (quality) in this verse establishes śrī-gaura-tattva to be as worshipful as śrī-kṛṣṇa-tattva. The Supreme Absolute Truth is both saguṇa, or possessed of all transcendental qualities, and nirguṇa, or devoid of all material qualities.]</small>\n\nThose who give up this twofold form of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Absolute, and worship the undifferentiated, all-pervading imper­sonal existence are intelligently looking for rice in empty husks.<br><br><small>[Although someone may be learned in all scriptures, his endeavors to obtain mukti (impersonal liberation) by worshiping the impersonal brahma will only amount to fruitless labor. In other words, such a person is not intelligent at all.]</small>\n\nBy the mercy of Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Prabhupāda, I worship Śrī Vinoda-bihārī and Śrīmatī Rādhikā as They meet with one another.<br><br><small>[By the mercy of śrī guru, I am granted darśana (a transcendental vision) of the Divine Couple, Śrī Śrī Rādha-Vinoda-bihārī, at the time of Their transcendental meeting.]</small>\n\nWhoever recites this aṣṭakam every day, with great faith, will fully comprehend kṛṣṇa-tattva and become immersed in meditation on the lotus feet of Śrī Gaurasundara."

After pursuing these paths for hundreds of millions of years, they may reach only as far as the tips of the toes of His lotus feet. I worship that original personality, Śrī Govinda.\n\nPotency and the possessor of potency are one undifferentiated principle. The potency by which billions of universes are created is situated inseparably within Bhagavān.

I worship that original personality, Śrī Govinda.\n\nDevī-dhāma, the material world, consists of fourteen planetary systems. Above this lies Maheśa-dhāma, above that Hari-dhāma, and above all lies Goloka, the abode of Svayam Bhagavān Śrī Govinda. I worship the original personality Govinda, who regulates the characteristic influence pertaining to each individual abode.\n\nThe shadow of the transcendental potency is that great potency who creates, maintains and annihilates the material universe. She is worshiped throughout the world as Durgā. I worship the original personality, Śrī Govinda, in accordance with whose desire Durgā conducts her every endeavor.\n\nŚrī Govinda-deva attains the condition of being Śambhu for the sake of performing a specific function, just as milk is transformed into yogurt by contact with a particular transforming agent, although yogurt is not a different substance, independent of milk, which is its cause. I worship that original personality, Śrī Govinda.\n\nI worship the original personality, Śrī Govinda. Just as when the flame of one lamp is transmitted to another lamp, the second lamp illuminates in the same manner as the original flame, although it exists separately, so does Govinda accept the form of Mahā-Viṣṇu reclining on the Causal Ocean. That Mahā-Viṣṇu is the source of all the Viṣṇu expansions and incarnations in this world.\n\nI worship that original personality, Śrī Govinda. Having assumed His own most excellent form, Śeṣa, the embodiment of the all-accommodating potency, He enjoys mystic slumber while reclining in the Causal Ocean with innumerable universes within every hair-pore of His skin.\n\nThe lords of the universes, such as Brahmā, who emanate from the hair-pores of Mahā-Viṣṇu’s skin, remain alive only for the duration of His one exhalation. I worship the original personality, Śrī Govinda, of whom Mahā-Viṣṇu is a portion of a portion.\n\nJust as the sun manifests his potency to a minute degree within jewels such as sūrya-kānta, and invests them with the power to burn, similarly Śrī Govinda also infuses His creative potency within the secondary creator of the universe, Brahmā. I worship that original personality, Śrī Govinda.\n\nIn order to obtain the power required to remove all the obstacles within the three worlds, Gaṇeśa, the bestower of success, always holds the divine lotus feet of Śrī Govinda upon the pair of cranial mounds protruding from his elephant head. I worship that original personality, Śrī Govinda.\n\nThe three worlds have been created from nine elements, namely earth, water, fire, air, space, the directions, time, the mind and soul. I worship the original personality, Śrī Govinda, from whom the elements have originated, in whom they are situated after their manifestation, and into whom they enter at the time of the cosmic annihilation.\n\nSūryadeva, the predominating deity of the sun, is the king of all the planets, and is likened to the eye of this world. I worship the original personality, Śrī Govinda, upon whose order the sun travels in his regular orbit, having mounted the wheel of time.\n\nI worship that original personality, Śrī Govinda, whose power of endowment alone manifests the respective potencies in the principles of religious conduct, sinful activities, the Vedas, various austerities and all living entities from Brahmā down to the most insignificant insect.\n\nŚrī Govinda impartially bestows the fruits of reaction upon all living entities who are wandering on the path of karma, from the insignificant indragopa insect to Indradeva, the monarch of the demigods, according to the bondage accrued from their respective individual actions. However, it is wonderful that He completely burns to the roots the karma of those who are devoted to Him. I worship that original personality, Śrī Govinda.\n\nThose who contemplate Him with feelings of lust, anger, the natural intimacy of friendship, fear, parental affection, bewilderment, reverence and servitude, attain bodies (suitable for associates of Bhagavān) with various degrees of beauty and qualities corresponding to their individual meditations. I worship that original personality, Govinda.\n\nI worship that supreme abode of Śvetadvīpa, where the beloved heroines are a host of transcendental goddesses of fortune, and the Supreme Personality Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the only lover; where all the trees are spiritual desire-trees, and the earth is made of transcendental wish-fulfilling cintāmaṇi jewels; where the water is nectar, natural speaking is a melodious song, and walking to and fro is an artful dance; where the flute is the dearmost friend; where light is full of knowledge and bliss, and the supreme spiritual substance that comprises all things is relishable; where a vast transcendental ocean of milk is always flowing from millions upon millions of surabhī cows; and where time is not subject to passing away, even for half the blink of an eye, because it is not divided into past and future, but remains in the undivided eternal present. That divine abode, which is practically unknown in this world, is known by the name of Goloka to only a few, rare sādhus."

      "en": "The gopīs said: O most beloved, because of Your birth in this land of Vraja, it has become even more glorious [than Vaikuṇṭha and other planets]. It is for this reason that Lakṣmī eternally decorates it with her presence. It is for Your sake alone that we, Your gopīs, maintain our lives. We are searching for You in all directions. Therefore, please show Yourself to us.\n\nO master of amorous pleasure, Śrī Kṛṣṇa! O bestower of benedic­tions, is killing us, your unpaid servants, by the glance of Your eyes, which steal even the proud beauty of the perfectly formed blossomed lotus, not considered murder?\n\nO crest-jewel among men, time and again You have saved us from all kinds of danger: from the poisonous water [of Kāliya-hrada], from Aghāsura, from torrential rains [showered down by Indra], from the whirlwind [created by Tṛṇāvarta], from [Indra’s] fiery thunderbolts, from the bull demon [Ariṣṭāsura], and from the son of Maya Dānava [Vyomāsura].\n\nO friend, You are certainly not only the son of Yaśodā, You are also the Supersoul, who resides in the heart of all living beings. In response to the prayer of Lord Brahmā, You have descended in the Yādava dynasty in order to protect the universe.\n\nO crest-jewel of the Yadu dynasty, O beloved, Your lotus hand grants fearlessness to those souls who, terrified by the cycle of birth and death, surrender to Your lotus feet. O fulfiller of our desires, please place on our heads that very lotus hand that grants fearlessness and that accepted Lakṣmī’s two hands.\n\nO hero, you destroy the sorrows of the residents of Vraja. Your mere smile shatters the pride (arising from the good fortune) of Your near and dear ones (and it also shatters the sulky mood [māna] arising from that pride). O dear friend, we are Your maidservants. (Therefore, for Your own pleasure,) kindly show us Your attractive lotus face.\n\nYour lotus feet destroy the past sins of surrendered souls. Those feet follow behind the cows that graze in the pastures. They are the abode of Lakṣmī-devī, and You placed them upon the hoods of a serpent (Kāliya). Please place those very lotus feet upon our breasts and subdue the lust in our hearts.\n\nO lotus-eyed one, we are bewildered by Your sweet voice and enchanting words, which capture the minds of clever, rasika scholars. O hero, we are Your maidservants. Please restore our lives with the divine ambrosia of Your lips.\n\nAmbrosial narrations about You are the life and soul of those tormented by separation from You. Greatly learned devotees (such as Brahmā, Śiva, and the four Kumāras) sing of them. These narrations vanquish the distress of fructified (prārabda) and unfructified (aprārabda) sins. Simply hearing them bestows auspiciousness, and they bestow the wealth of prema. Persons who glorify Your pastimes expand the nectar of narrations about You. Therefore, that person who performs kīrtana of Your līlā-kathā in this world is the most generous benefactor.\n\nO beloved, meditating on Your smiling face, love-laden glances, amorous play, and heart-touching conversations in secret places bestows the greatest joy. But, O cheater, they also greatly torment our mind.\n\nO master, O beloved, when You leave Vraja to take the cows and other animals out to graze, the soles of Your feet, which are as tender as a lotus, must suffer great pain from sharp pebbles, grass, and the edges of dry grains. When we think about this, our minds become very distressed.\n\nAt twilight, when You repeatedly show us Your lotus face, which is framed by bluish-black locks of hair and covered in dust from the hooves of cows, You arouse amorous desire within our heart.\n\nO dearmost beloved, O destroyer of all sorrow, Your lotus feet fulfill all desires of Your surrendered devotees. They are worshiped by Brahmā, and they are the ornament of the Earth. When meditated upon, they remove all calamity; when accepting service, they bestow supreme bliss. Kindly place those lotus feet upon our breasts.\n\nThe nectar of Your lips increases the pleasure of amorous union, and it vanquishes sorrow (or separation from You). Your ambrosial lips are passionately kissed by Your singing flute, and they cause every human being to forget all other attachments. O hero, please make us drink the nectar of Your lips.\n\nO beloved, unable to see You as You roam the forest during the day, we experience every moment as a millennium. Then (upon Your return from the forest at dusk,) we eagerly gaze upon Your exquisitely beautiful lotus face adorned with curly locks (and become greatly perturbed by the occasional blinking of our eyes). At that time, the creator of eyelids seems like a fool to us.\n\nO Acyuta, we have come to You, having rejected our husbands, sons, brothers, friends, and our entire family. O cheater, You know very well why we came here. We have come, bewitched by the loud song of Your flute. Who but You would abandon young ladies who have come to You alone in the night?\n\nO beloved master, having seen You as You conversed intimately with us in secret places—Your smiling face, which acts as a stimulus for our amorous desires, Your glancing at us with love, and Your expansive chest, which is the eternal resting place of the goddess of fortune—our hankering to meet with You has increased manifold, and our minds are repeatedly bewildered.\n\nO Kṛṣṇa, Your appearance [on this earth] completely destroys the sorrows of Vraja’s residents, and in every way it brings auspiciousness to the world. Our hearts long for You alone. Therefore, kindly give in charity a little bit of that medicine, which can cure the heart-disease of Your dear ones.\n\nO beloved, fearing that Your tender lotus feet will be hurt, we carefully place them on our hard breasts. With those very same feet, You wander in the forest. Are Your feet not in pain, injured by needle-sharp stones and other sharp objects? You are our very life; thinking of all this fills our hearts with great distress.\n\nŚrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: O King [Parīkṣit], having thus sung and lamented in various ways, the gopīs began to weep bitterly in sweet voices, greatly eager  to see their beloved Kṛṣṇa.\n\nJust then, Madana-mohana Śrī Kṛṣṇa directly appeared before the weeping vraja-devīs, gently smiling and wearing a forest garland and a yellow garment."
