rādhe jhulana padhāro jhukī āye badarā,
jhukī āye badarā, ghira āye badarā (1)

eso māna nāhí kijiye hātha chāḍoḍī āli,
tum to parama sayāni bṛṣabhānu kī lalī (2)

sājo solah śringar dāro nainana kajarā,
paharo pancha-raṅg sāḍī aur śyām chadarā (3)

tero rasika pritam hātha joḍata kaḍo,
rādhe jahān paga dhāro śyāma nayanā dharo (4)

ḍāro reśama ḍorī jape jhule rādhā gorī,
jākī bahiyān gorī gorī pahane harī chuḍiyā (5)`,

    "en": "“O Rādhā, go and sit on the swing. Low rain clouds have come and filled the sky.

“Give up Your sulky mood, O friend. Don’t be stubborn like this. You are the dear, highly intelligent daughter of King Vṛṣabhānu.

“Decorate Yourself with sixteen kinds of ornaments and line your eyes with kajjal. Don your five-colored sārī and cover yourself with a thin, dark veil.

“Your playful beloved is waiting for You on the path. O Rādhā, wherever You place Your feet, Śyāma’s eyes follow.”

Silken ropes are hung, upon which fair Rādhā is swinging. Her golden arms are decorated with floral bracelets."
