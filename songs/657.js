    "en": "Worship the lotus feet of śrī guru, O mind. Without guru’s mercy, we have no strength in our sādhana. O mind, worship guru, worship him at every moment.

This rare human birth is not often found as we scour the fourteen planes of existence. A chance few, by astounding good fortune, get to glimpse a devotee of Śrī Hari.

He is the blissful embodiment of Kṛṣṇa’s mercy and the reservoir of compassion for the destitute. Manifesting bhakti, bhāva, and prema, śrī guru is the savior of the fallen.

All the Śrutis, Smṛtis and Purāṇas describe śrī guru’s glories; there is clear evidence of this. Offering my body, mind, and very life at the feet of Gurudeva, I incessantly sing śrī harināma.

Gurudeva, have mercy on me, take me as your own. I fall before you, taking shelter of you. Please grant me a place at your feet.

Your name is the repository of compassion; kindly shower me with that. O Master, rouse my sleeping fortune! My boat is caught in a whirlpool. Kindly rescue it.

You are an ocean of happiness and the nurturer of devotion. You are always on my mind. You are more dear to me than life itself. Incessantly I chant your name. Kindly forget my faults.

I am a servant of the Vaiṣṇavas and am forever sold at the feet of my guru. O master, please do not forget me, who am all alone in this world. I am a beggar at your door. Please do not let your heart forget me."
