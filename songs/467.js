Out of compassion for the living beings, Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu descended in this world along with His personal associates and divine abode.

In order to bestow the extremely rare treasure of prema-bhakti, He taught śaraṇāgati, which is the life and soul of the devotees.

Humility, submission of the self, acceptance of the Lord as one’s only maintainer, faith in Kṛṣṇa’s protection…

…acceptance of acts favorable for bhakti and rejection of that which is unfavorable.

Whoever embodies each of these six facets of śaraṇāgati has their prayers heard by the son of Nanda Mahārāja.

With a straw between his teeth, Bhaktivinoda prostrates before Śrī Rūpa and Śrī Sanātana, embracing their lotus feet.

Weeping, he says, “I am the lowest of men! Kindly teach me unconditional surrender and make me an excellent Vaiṣṇava.”`
