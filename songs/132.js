    "en": "Illuminating the seven islands of the world, Śrī Navadvīpa-purī shines due to the presence of that king among the gods, Śrī Viśvambhara. There, in the midst of Śrī Viśvambhara’s bhaktas, is the renowned Śrīvāsa Paṇḍita, whose life’s mission is śrī-kṛṣṇa-kīrtana.

All glories, all glories to Paṇḍita Ṭhākura. By a speck of his mercy, one can become a recipient of gaura-prema. All of his pastimes are matchless.

Exclusively fixed in the sevā of Gaurāṅga, he does not know any demigod or goddess. Along with his four brothers, servants, and maidservants, he always revels in kīrtana—day and night—with Gaurāṅga and His devotees, intoxicated by prema.

His wife, Śrī Mālinī-devī, whom Mahāprabhu calls ‘Mother,’ is the crown-jewel of all chaste women. Nityānanda Prabhu resides in their house, and she loves Him as her own son. When she sees Nityānanda Prabhu, milk flows from her breasts and tears fall from her eyes.

Sometimes, knowing Mahāprabhu to be the Supreme Lord, Śrīvāsa Paṇḍita bows down at His lotus feet. But sometimes he takes Him on his lap to nourish Him. In order not to interupt the ecstatic dance of Mahāprabhu, he renounced any expression of sorrow at the death of his son. Hearing of this, the Lord wept.

Śrīvāsa Paṇḍita’s niece Nārāyaṇī was the voice of the Vaiṣṇava assembly. Her son Śrī Vṛndāvana dāsa described Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s līlās and thus delivered the three worlds. It is in him [Śrīvāsa Paṇḍita] that Prema dāsa keeps his hopes and aspirations."
