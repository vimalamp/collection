O Hari! Offering and receiving gifts; sharing and discussing confidential topics; accepting and offering prasāda—these are the six characteristics of [devotional] association, in which lies the life of bhakti.

Not comprehending this essential truth and having engaged knowingly or unknowingly in these exchanges with non-devotees, I have lost all devotion and have become a materialist. As a result, You remain very far away, O Hari.

When I respect devotees of Śrī Kṛṣṇa in accordance with these types of association, then Bhakti-Mahādevī will sit upon the throne of my heart.

Shunning the company of both those who are attached to women and those who are non-devotees, when will I have the perpetual association of Your devotees, O Hari?`
