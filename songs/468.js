bhuliyā tomāre,    saṁsāre āsiyā,
peye nānābidha byathā |
tomāra caraṇe,    āsiyāchi āmi,
bôlibô duḥkhera kathā ||1||

jananī-jaṭhare,    chilāma ĵakhôna,
biṣama bandhanapāśe |
ekabāra prabhu,    dekhā diyā more,
bañcile e dīna dāse ||2||

takhôna bhābinu,    janama pāiyā,
kôribô bhajana taba |
janama hô_ilô,    pôḓi’ māyā-jāle,
nā hô_ilô jñāna-laba ||3||

ādarera chele,    svajanera kole,
hāsiyā kāṭānu kāla |
janaka-jananī,    snehete bhuliyā,
saṁsāra lāgilô bhālô ||4||

krame dina dina,    bālaka hô_iyā,
khelinu bālaka-saha |
āra kichu dine,    jñāna upajilô,
pāṭha pôḓi’ aharahaḥ ||5||

bidyāra gaurabe,    bhrami’ deśe deśe,
dhana upārjjana kôri |
svajana-pālana,    kôri ekamane,
bhulinu tomāre hari !!6!!

bārddhakye ekhôna,    bhakativinoda,
kā̃diyā kātara ati |
nā bhajiyā tore,    dina bṛthā gela,
ekhôna ki ha’be gati !!7!!

    "en": "Forgetting You and falling into worldliness, I have suffered many pains. Now, falling at Your feet, I shall tell You my woeful tale.

When I was still in my mother’s womb, I was tightly confined. Once, O Lord, You appeared to me. However, this lowly servitor was simply cheated...

...for I thought that I would take birth and serve You. Instead, I was born and fell into the net of māyā, without a trace of wisdom.

Smothered with affection by my family members, sitting in their laps laughing, I wasted time. I forgot everything for the fondness of my parents; worldly life struck me as quite appealing.

I gradually became a small child, playing with other small children. As my awareness of the world grew, I began my daily schooling.

Proud of my learning, I travelled abroad in search of wealth. Fixated on the maintenance of my family, I forgot You, O Hari!

Now aged, Bhaktivinoda weeps, greatly distressed. In not serving You, all my days were wasted. Now what will become of me?"
