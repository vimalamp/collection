O Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Prabhu, be merciful to me. Except for You, who in this material existence is so full of compassion?

The reason for Your descent is to deliver the fallen souls. O Lord, You will not find anyone else as fallen as me.

O Nityānanda Prabhu, who is always joyful in ecstatic love, glance upon me with compassion, for I am very sorrowful.

O Advaita Gosāi, husband of Sītā, be kind to me. By the power of Your mercy, I can surely attain Śrī Caitanya-Nitāi.

Alas! O Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī, Sanātana Gosvāmī, Rūpa Gosvāmī, and Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī! O Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī, Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī, and Śrī Jīva Gosvāmī! O my master, Lokanātha Gosvāmī [give me your mercy]!

Be merciful, O Prabhu Śrīnivāsa Ācārya! Narottama dāsa begs for the association of Rāmacandra Kavirāja.`
