    "en": "May Nanda’s darling little boy dwell in my eyes.

An enchanting form, an enticing dark complexion, His eyes fashioned large and lovely…

The nectar of His lips slips into His flute-playing, and He wears a garland of fresh wildflowers.

Tiny bells adorn His waist, and the sound of His ankle bells is very sweet.

Mīrā’s master pleases the saintly. He is especially affectionate to His devotees. He is Gopāla, caretaker of the cows."
