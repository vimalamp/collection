You are an ocean of mercy. To deliver the living beings, You have brought and taught Your innumerable holy names.

You have invested Your full potency in Your holy names and have made no restrictions regarding time or place.

The touchstone of śrī nāma is equal to You. You have distributed this treasure-house of mercy throughout the entire creation.

Such is Your supremely magnanimous compassion, O Lord, but my luck is extremely poor.

My anurāga (intense affection) for śrī nāma has never awakened. Thus, the heart of Bhaktivinoda is overcome with sorrow.`
