First of all, I offer glorification at the feet of all the Vaiṣṇavas who are residents of Vṛndāvana.

Falling to the ground [in prostration], I pray to the feet of Śrīman Mahāprabhu’s associates who are residents of Nīlācala.

Becoming filled with loving attachment, I submit my glorification at the feet of all Mahāprabhu’s devotees who are residents of Navadvīpa.

Bowing down in obeisance, I pray to the feet of all Mahāprabhu’s devotees who are situated in Gauḓa-deśa.

Raising my arms, I offer glorification at the feet of all Gaurāṅga’s associates, in whichever country they may reside.

Holding a straw between my teeth, I submit my glorification at the feet of all the servants of Mahāprabhu who ever were or will be.

Each of His devotees possesses the power to deliver the entire universe. The Vedas and Purāṇas glorify this divine quality of the Vaiṣṇava to all willing to listen.

All the associates of Mahāprabhu are saviors of the fallen, so I, a sinner, fervently take shelter of them.

What power do I have to glorify them? Afflicted by ignorance, I only exhibit conceit.

Yet, even one who is dumb [such as me] is greatly fortunate and joyful at heart [to have an opportunity to glorify them]. [O Vaiṣṇavas,] forgive the faults of this fallen soul and make me your own servant.

[By the Vaiṣṇavas’ mercy] one’s desires are perfected, the fetters of Yama (the lord of death) are quickly released, and the treasure of prema, which is rare within this world, is plundered [and distributed].

They quickly fulfill the heart’s longings. With this in mind, Devakīnandana utters this vaiṣṇava-vandanā.`
