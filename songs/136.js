All glories, all glories to the greatly merciful Advaita Ācārya. It was due to his loud roar that Śrī Gaura descended.

He is the giver of prema, the lord of Sīta-devī, and an ocean of compassion. Due to his nectarean love, the hero of Vraja came again.

To whomever he wants to mercifully bestow his grace, that person sings the glories of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, submerged in prema-rasa.

He who takes shelter of his lotus feet attains the supreme wealth of gaura-prema.

Locana dāsa says, “Why have I not worshiped such a treasure-house of mercy? Instead, I have struck my own head with a thunderbolt!”`
