ohe preme ṭhākura gorā
prāṇera yātanā kibā kabo nātha! hayechi āpana-hārā (1)

ki āra baliba, je kājera tare enechile nātha! jagate āmāre,
eta-dina pare kahite se-kathā khede duḥkhe hai sārā (2)

tomāra bhajane nā janmila rati, jaḍa-mohe mata sadā duramati-
viṣayīra kāche theke theke āmi hainu viṣayī-pārā (3)

ke āmi, kena je esechi ekhāne, se-kathā kakhano nāhi bhāvi mane,
kakhano bhogera, kakhano tyāgera chalanāya mana nāce (4)

ki gati haibe, kakhano bhāvi nā, hari-bhakatera kācheo jāi nā,
hari-vimukhera kulakṣaṇa yata āmātei saba āche (5)

śrī-guru-kṛpāya bheṅgeche svapana, bujhechi ekhana tumi-i āpana,
tava nija-jana parama bāndhava saṁsāra-kārāgāre (6)

āna nā bhajiba bhakta-pada vinu, rātula caraṇe śaraṇa lainu,
uddhāraha nātha! māyā-jāla ha’te e dāsera keśe dha’re (7)

pātakīre tumi kṛpā kara nāki? jagāi-mādhāi chila je pātakī,
tāhāte jenechi,–premera ṭhākura pātakīreo tāra’ tumi (8)

āmi bhakti-hīna, dīna, akiñcana–aparādhī-śire dāo du’caraṇa,
tomāra abhaya śrī-caraṇe cira-śaraṇa lainu āmi (9)

O Gaura, Lord of prema! What shall I tell You of the sufferings of my life, O Master? I have lost my true self.

What more shall I say? O Lord, after so long, to speak of the purpose for which You brought me to the world, I become weary with lamentation and sorrow.

Attachment to bhajana of You has not awakened within me, I am intoxicated by the mundane and the illusory, and my intelligence is always wicked. By remaining near sense enjoyers, I have become just like them.

Who am I? Why have I come here? My mind never ponders these questions. Sometimes enjoying and sometimes renouncing, my mind only dances in beguilement.

I never contemplate what my outcome will be. I do not even go near the devotees of Hari. All the inauspicious symptoms of one who opposes Hari are within me.

By śrī guru’s grace my illusory dream has been broken. I now understand that You alone are mine and that Your associates are my greatest friends in this prison house of material existence.

I will not worship anything besides the feet of Your devotees. I have taken shelter of the crimson soles of Your lotus feet. O Lord! Rescue me from māyā’s entangling net by pulling this servant by the hair.

Do you not deliver the sinners? Jagāi and Mādhāi were sinners [and you delivered them], so, Lord of prema, I know that it's true, you do indeed deliver the sinners [like myself].

I am devoid of bhakti, wretched and destitute. Place both Your lotus feet upon the head of this offender. At Your beautiful feet, which instill fearlessness, I take eternal shelter.`
