    "en": "Behold the unparalleled beauty of the son of Mother Śacī. He is an incomparable reservoir of nectarean rasa.

Tortured by the pangs of separation that arise in His mind, due to His intense attachment to Kṛṣṇa, He manifests the most exquisite yet terrifying pastimes of ecstasy.

Totally absorbing Himself in thoughts of the Supreme Being Lord Jagannātha, He constantly experiences the pain of separation, yet He is that very same Supreme Personality whose adorable feet are decorated by the lotus hands of Kamalā (Lakṣmī-devī).

Transformations of ecstasy appear in His body, His face becomes intensely flushed and His voice falters. This Rādhā-mohana dāsa is simply hoping to attain His lotus feet."
