O Harināma, You possess unlimited forms. You are the darling son of Mother Yaśodā, and You increase the bliss [of Gokula]. You are the beloved son of Nanda Mahārāja, and You are a deep well of rasa.

You are the slayer of the witch Pūtanā, the killer of the demon Tṛṇāvarta, the destroyer of the demon Śakaṭa [the cart demon], and the protector of the cows. You are the player of the flute, the subduer of the demons Aghāsura and Bakāsura, the lifter of Govardhana Hill, and a cowherd boy.

You are the vanquisher of the demon Keśī, You bewilder Lord Brahmā, and You destroy the pride of the king of the demigods [Lord Indra]. You are the killer of the demon Ariṣṭa, the enchanter of the gopīs, and the performer of playful pastimes on the banks of the Yamunā River.

You are the delight of Śrīmatī Rādhikā, You are He who brings the elixir of life to the rāsa dance, and You are the enjoyer of pastimes in the kuñjas at Rādhā-kuṇḍa. You are the reservoir of pleasure, the all-attractive one, the remover of inauspiciousness, the husband of the goddess of fortune, the half-man half-lion incarnation known as Nṛsiṁhadeva, and the source of all other incarnations, beginning with the fish, Matsya.

You are the protector of the cows, the dwarf-brāhmaṇa incarna­tion, the slayer of the demon Madhu, the moon of the Yadu dynasty, and He who wears beautiful garlands of fresh forest flowers. You are the punisher of the serpent Kālīya, the delighter of Gokula, and He who takes pleasure in worshiping and meditating on Śrīmatī Rādhikā.

Clasping the lotus feet of Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī and Śrī Svarūpa Dāmodara, understanding them to be his sole assets, Bhaktivinoda humbly begs, “May my love and attachment for all these forms of the holy name, which have appeared by their own sweet will, ever increase.”`
