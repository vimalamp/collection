Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the lover of Śrī Rādhā and is the enjoyer of pastimes in the forest groves of Vraja. He is the dearmost beloved of the gopīs and the lifter of Govardhana Hill. He is the darling son of Mother Yaśodā, He gives pleasure to the residents of Vraja, and He wanders in the forests along the banks of the Yamunā River.`
