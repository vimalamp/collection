All glories, all glories to Śrī Gadādhara Paṇḍita. By the strength of his mercy, one can sing about the qualities of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

His love for the moon-like Gaurāṅga is such that Gaurāṅga is celebrated as Gadādhara-prāṇanātha, the Lord of Gadādhara’s life.

Who can understand the prema of he whose heart is one with Gaurāṅga, for whom he gave up his kṣetra-vāsa [his vow to forever stay in the holy town of Purī] and his sevā to Śrī Kṛṣṇa [at Ṭoṭa Gopīnātha]?

Gaurāṅga is Gadādhara’s and Gadādhara is Gaurāṅga’s, just as Śrī Rāma and Jānakī (Sīta-devī) are one body.

Just as Śrī Rādhā and Śrī Vṛndāvana-candra are one in heart, waves of prema flow between Gaura and Gadādhara.

Śivānanda says, “It is by his anurāga (that is, Śrī Rādhā’s deep attachment) that Śyāma-tanu (dark-complexioned Kṛṣṇa) has now become the golden Śrī Gaurāṅga, and is begging for that prema.”`
