rādhā nāma parama sukha dāi,
lahara-lahara śrī syāmā ju kī,
      mana me merī samāi (1)

raṭa-raṭa rādhā janama bitāu,
      braja gopina ku śisa navāu,
mahimā kahi nāhi jāi (2)

braja tyaja ke maiṅ kahi nahi jau,
      rasika santana ke darsana pāu,
jaga se priti hatāi (3)`,

    "en": "Rādhā’s name confers supreme joy.

May [thoughts of] Śrī Śyāmā gather, wave after wave, in my mind.

Incessantly chanting ‘Rādhā’, I will live out my life. To the gopīs of Vraja, my head will remain bowed, for their glories are indescribable.

I will never leave Vraja to go elsewhere, and I will gain the darśana of rasika saints, thereby removing my affection for the world."
