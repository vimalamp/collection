śrī govardhana mahārāja,
tere māthe mukuṭa virāja rahyo (1)

tere kānana kuṇḍala sohe rahe,
aura gala vaijayanti māla (2)

tere mukha pe muralīyā sohe rahī,
ṭorī pe hīrā lāla (3)

tere aṅga meiṅ jāmā keśariyā,
aura patkā lāla gulāla (4)

tope pāna caḍhe aur phūla chaḍhe,
tope diye jareṅ dina rāta (5)

tere mānasī-gangā nikaṭa vahe,
tope caḍhe dudha kī dhāra (6)

terī sāta koṣa kī parikrammā,
aura cakaleśvara viśrāma,
śrī govardhana kī jaya bolo! (7)`,

    "en": "O Govardhana Mahārāja! Your head is adorned with a beautiful crown.

From your ears dangle dazzling earrings, and from your neck hangs a splendid vaijayantī garland.

Upon your lips rests the muralī flute, and upon your chin a red ruby shines.

Your body is covered with a saffron-colored tunic and a reddish-pink cādara.

You are presented with betel nuts, flowers, and lit ghee-lamps, day and night.

Mānasī-gaṅgā flows near you, and you are bathed in a shower of milk.

Your seven kosa (fourteen mile) parikramā is completed at Cakaleśvara."
