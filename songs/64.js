    "en": "I adore Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the young son of Mahārāja Nanda, who is a thief of fresh butter.

I worship Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who awakens greed in the hearts of the munis, whose form is enchanting, whose muralī flute sways to and fro [in His hand], and who is the God of love and the protector of the cows.

I worship Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who is the Lord of Lakṣmī-devī (the goddess of fortune) and Pṛthivī-devī (the earth goddess), and the sustainer of this cosmic manifestation. His veṇu flute sways to and fro [in His hand], and He is the very essence of the conclusive truths of the Vedas.

I worship Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the young son of Mahārāja Nanda, who took a morsel of curd [in His hand] and whose complexion is changed by flower pollen."
