All glories to You, O beautiful son of Nanda! You perform spring­time pastimes on the river banks of Vṛndāvana, which is full of fragrance.

Your mass of curling locks is adorned brilliantly with a bunch of fresh blossoms. You are decorated with colored powders, mixed with camphor, that are thrown by Your beloveds.

Your restless, sidelong glance causes anurāgiṇī Śrī Rādhā to undergo ecstatic transformations of amorous love. Your lovely dancing gait, which enchants the entire universe, causes Your jeweled necklace to sway to and fro.

The dazzling, gentle smile upon Your lips incites eagerness in Your near and dear associates. You are the well-wisher of Your dear ones, and You perpetually descend to engage in festive sport within their hearts [or within the heart of Sanātana Gosvāmī].`
