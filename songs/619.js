O brothers! Knowing that Balarāma and Kṛṣṇa will go to distant forests to tend Their cows, Mother Yaśodā and Mother Rohiṇī brought kṣīra (sweetened condensed milk), sāra (thick cream), chānā (milk curd), and nanī (fresh butter) to feed the two boys. In this way their hearts filled with the ecstasy of motherly affection.

All the companion cowherd boys take lunch with Balarāma and Kṛṣṇa. They dance and sing, feeling inner bliss. They eat Kṛṣṇa’s remnants and their bellies become full, but still they exclaim, “Give us more! Give us more!”`
