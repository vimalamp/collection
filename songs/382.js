The golden-complexioned savior of the age of Kali, Śrī Gaurahari, sings as follows, overwhelmed with bhāva.

All glories to śrī kṛṣṇa-kīrtana, which cleanses the mirror of the heart and delights the soul.

All glories to śrī kṛṣṇa-kīrtana, which, even if chanted indifferently, has the tendency to extinguish the forest fire of material existence and end all suffering.

All glories to śrī kṛṣṇa-kīrtana, which casts moonbeams upon the white lotus of good fortune [causing it to bloom] and which is a loving pastime of bhakti.

All glories to śrī kṛṣṇa-kīrtana, the life of the bride of transcen­dental knowledge and the embodiment of perfection.

All glories to śrī kṛṣṇa-kīrtana, which is glorified for expanding the ocean of transcendental bliss and which is the embodiment of the deluge [of prema].

All glories to śrī kṛṣṇa-kīrtana, which bestows the taste of nectar at every step. This chanting is the fountainhead of pure love of God.

All glories to śrī kṛṣṇa-kīrtana, which bathes the soul of Bhaktivinoda and which is the root cause of prema.`
