hari hari! (govinda gopinātha) kṛpā kari’ rākha nija pade
kāma-krodha chaya-jane, lao phire nānā-sthāne,

haiyā māyāra dāsa, kari’ nānā abhilāṣa,
        tomāra smaraṇa gela dūre
artha-lābha ei āśe, kapaṭa vaiṣṇava-veśe,
        bramiyā bulaye ghare ghare (2)

aneka duḥkhera pare, layechila vrajapure,
        kṛpā-ḍora galāya bāndhiyā
daiva-māyā balāt kāre, khasāiyā sei ḍore,
        bhava-kūpe dileka ḍāriyā (3)

punaḥ yadi kṛpā kari’, e janāra keśe dhari’,
        ṭāniyā tulaha vraja-dhāme
tabe se dekhiye bhāla, natuvā parāṇa gela,
        kahe dīna <b>dāsa narottame</b> (4)

O Śrī Hari, be merciful and keep me at Your lotus feet. Six adversaries, headed by lust and anger, are dragging me to various places and causing me to gratify my senses in various ways.

I have become a servant of māyā and have various material desires. Thus my remembrance of You has fled far away. Disguised as a Vaiṣṇava, I wander from house to house with the desire to collect money.

After I suffered many miseries, You tied Your rope of mercy around my neck and brought me to Vraja. But then māyā forcibly untied that rope and threw me into the well of material existence.

If you mercifully grasp this person’s hair and pull him to the abode of Vraja once again, then he will be saved; otherwise, his life will end. Thus prays the wretched Narottama dāsa.`
